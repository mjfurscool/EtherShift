use wasd to move, the mouse to aim, r to reload, 
f to switch characters and q to use a potion ,spacebar or 
left click tointeract with things such as shops and dialouge boxes

the pink character meo uses a gun as her left click and a laser
right click which can be upgraded.

the blue character wing is a melee character, 
where his left click is a punch, right click is an offensive dash
and r is an aoe stun. wing is more effective against shielded targets,
then once the shield is down, meo can start doing more damage with the guns

when you switch characters you are invincible and the character not in use regenerates
their resources.
